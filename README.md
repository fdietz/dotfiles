These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

## Installation
Copy and paste the following line into your terminal:

    curl https://raw.github.com/fdietz/dotfiles/install.sh -L -o - | sh

Or manually clone dotfiles and run the installer script:

    git clone https://github.com/fdietz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh

Use the osx script:

    ./osx
